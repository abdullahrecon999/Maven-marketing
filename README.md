# Maven Marketing

Final Year Project (FYP) for batch FA19. Influencer marketing is a marketing strategy where brands collaborate with influencers who have a dedicated following. This approach leverages the influencer's reach to promote the company and its products, increase brand awareness, and drive sales. The proposed system allows brands to advertise, run campaigns, and sponsor influencers to enhance their market performance, using social media platforms.
